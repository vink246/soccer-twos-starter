# Soccer-Twos Starter Kit

Example training/testing scripts for the Soccer-Twos environment. This starter code is modified from the example code provided in https://github.com/bryanoliveira/soccer-twos-starter.

Environment-level specification code can be found at https://github.com/bryanoliveira/soccer-twos-env, which may also be useful to reference.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Usage

### 1. Fork this repository

git clone https://github.com/your-github-user/soccer-twos-starter.git

cd soccer-twos-starter/

### 2. Create and activate conda environment
conda create --name soccertwos python=3.8 -y

conda activate soccertwos

### 3. Downgrade build tools for compatibility
pip install pip==23.3.2 setuptools==65.5.0 wheel==0.38.4

pip cache purge

### 4. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 5. Fix protobuf and pydantic compatibility
pip install protobuf==3.20.3

pip install pydantic==1.10.13

### 5. Run `python example_random.py` to watch a random agent play the game
python example_random_players.py

### 6. Train using any of the example scripts
python example_ray_ppo_sp_still.py

python example_ray_team_vs_random.py

etc.

## Agent Packaging

To receive full credit on the assignment and ensure the teaching staff can properly compile your code, you must follow these instructions:

- Implement a class that inherits from `soccer_twos.AgentInterface` and implements an `act` method. Examples are located under the `example_player_agent/` or `example_team_agent/` directories.
- Fill in your agent's information in the `README.md` file (agent name, authors & emails, and description)
- Compress each agent's module folder as `.zip`.

*Submission Policy*: Students must submit multiple trained agents to meet all assignment requirements. In both the agent desription and the report, clearly identify which agent file corresponds to each evaluation criterion (e.g., Agent1 – policy performance, Agent2 – reward modification, Agent3 – imitation learning, etc.). 

Training plots are required for every agent that is discussed or submitted. Additionally, include a direct performance comparison across agents, such as overlaid learning curves, to support your analysis.


## Testing/Evaluating

Use the environment's rollout tool to test the example agent module:

`python -m soccer_twos.watch -m example_player_agent`

Similarly, you can test your own agent by replacing `example_player_agent` with the name of your agent directory.

The baseline agent is located here: [pre-trained baseline (download)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WEjr48D7QG9uVy1tf4GJAZTpimHtINzE/view?usp=sharing).
To examine the baseline agent, you must extract the `ceia_baseline_agent` folder to this project's folder. For instance you can run, 

`python -m soccer_twos.watch -m1 example_player_agent -m2 ceia_baseline_agent`

, to examine the random agent vs. the baseline agent.


## Team-specific additions

This section describes additions made by the team for training and running on shared infrastructure (e.g. PACE ICE).

### `train_ppo_team.py` — PPO training with run folders and plots

A dedicated PPO training script that:

- **Run folders**: Each run is stored in its own timestamped directory under `team_runs/` (e.g. `team_runs/PPO_team_20260308_193000/`). Checkpoints and plots live under that folder.
- **Dashboard disabled**: Uses `ray.init(include_dashboard=False)` to avoid hostname resolution issues on WSL and on PACE head nodes.
- **Plots every N steps**: Saves learning-curve plots (episode reward mean vs timesteps/iteration) every N training iterations into the trial's `plots/` subfolder. Requires `matplotlib` (`pip install matplotlib`).
- **GPU**: Uses 1 GPU by default. Override with `--num-gpus` or set `PACE_NUM_GPUS` / `NUM_GPUS` in the environment (e.g. on PACE ICE).

**Usage**

```bash
# Default: team_runs/PPO_team_<timestamp>, plot every 10 iters, 2M timesteps
python train_ppo_team.py

# Custom output dir, plot frequency, and max timesteps
python train_ppo_team.py --output-dir my_runs --plot-freq 5 --max-timesteps 500000

# More workers, explicit GPU count
python train_ppo_team.py --num-workers 8 --num-gpus 1
```

**Options**

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `--output-dir` | `team_runs` | Base directory for run folders. |
| `--plot-freq` | `10` | Save a plot every N training iterations. |
| `--max-timesteps` | `2000000` | Stop after this many env timesteps. |
| `--num-workers` | `8` | Number of Ray workers. |
| `--num-gpus` | 1 (or env) | Number of GPUs (overrides `PACE_NUM_GPUS` / `NUM_GPUS`). |

**Running on PACE ICE**

- Run the script from your job script or interactive allocation as you would any Python job.
- To use multiple GPUs, set `PACE_NUM_GPUS` (or `NUM_GPUS`) in the job environment, or pass `--num-gpus N`.
- The dashboard is disabled by default, so no web UI; use the saved plots in each run's `plots/` folder to monitor progress.
- Checkpoints are written under the same run directory (e.g. `team_runs/PPO_team_<timestamp>/PPO_Soccer/.../checkpoint_*/`).

**Optional dependency for plots**

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

If `matplotlib` is not installed, training still runs but no plot files are saved.
